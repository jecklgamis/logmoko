  Logmoko is a small logging framework for use with the C programming language. 
  It allows user to control which log statements are logged based on a 
  configured log level and to which interface (e.g. console, file, remote 
  connection).

  Logmoko was developed from a refactored logging facility used in
  RCUNIT, a C unit testing framework. It was also inspired by modern loggers 
  used in Java.
